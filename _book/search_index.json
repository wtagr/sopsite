In order to enter matlab from command line enter ‘matlab’. To specify the edition type ‘matlab2017b’ or equivalent. Once in matlab it’s convenient to load all of the toolboxes you might use for fMRI analyses at once. This is held in a matlab script and can be called using run('~timothy/matlab/startup.m') open GIFT by entering groupica. This will open a GUI interface. 7.3 Running Infomax ICA Infomax is the most basic ICA algorthim and takes the fewest inputs. Simply specify the files and number of independent components you want to run. gica_cmd –data ‘C:001.nii’ ‘C:002.nii –n 15 7.4 Running GIG-ICA analysis GIG-ICA uses the spatial maps generated from Infomax run, so before running GIG-ICA, go through and run the entire Infomax method. gica_cmd –data ‘C:001.nii’ ‘C:002.nii’ ‘C:003.nii’ –templates ‘C:_ref.nii’ –a gig-ica 7.5 ICA output files 7.6 "]]
