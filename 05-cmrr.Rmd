# CMRR  
## First time CMRR users  
1. You will need to set up your CMRR Password and figure out your login id. To do this follow \href{https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/access/}{this link.} This time, instead of clicking 'Register' click 'Login' and login with your x500 (normal UMN credentials).
2. Then in the tabs on the CMRR page click 'My Profile' then 'Change CMRR Server Password'.
3. First, write down your login ID
4.  Then, enter a new password (this will be used only when accessing CMRR machines through NoMachine. More on that later).
5. it will take a few minutes for your password to update and a day or two for your initial access to be granted to the CMRR computers.
